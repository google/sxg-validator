<h2>Welcome to the help page of the Signed Exchange Validator Chrome Extension.</h2>
<p>
    This tool is intended to help website administrators determine the status
    of their Signed Exchange deployments. It may include the status of the origin
    URL, its corresponding Google SXG Cache URL as well as the Google SXG Certificate
    URL.
</p>
<div class="label-container">
  <div class="origin-image" alt="Origin URL State" id="originimg">
   The different images the tool displays indicates the status of either the origin, cache or cert.
   <br><br>
   ... means it's processing.
   <br>
   ⌛ means not in cache yet.
   <br>
   ✅ means everything's ok.
   <br>
   ❌ means there's an error or the URL is not a Signed Exchange.
   <br>
   If there's an ❌ in the Origin section, it means that your server is not producing a signed exchange.
   <br>
   Consult the documentation for your SXG server to determine why.
   <br>
   A common cause is a Cache-Control header that prevents public caching, such as no-store or private.
   <br>
   If there's an ❌ in the Cache or Cert section, there should be a Warning Message saying why.
